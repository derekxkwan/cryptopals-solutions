# cryptopals-solutions

solutions to the [cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) crypto challenges in Racket organized by problem set

- filenames take the format `x_y.rkt` where x is the problem set and y is the challenge number
- **progress so far** - completed set1: 1,2,3

## Notes
### Set 1
- my custom functions for hex encoding/decoding and base64 encoding are found in `set_1/hex_base64.rkt`, which is called by my solution files
- 1_3.rkt is modularized for use in other files, use `racket set_1/1_3.rkt run` to run the file
